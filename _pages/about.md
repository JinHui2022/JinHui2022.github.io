*"As humans we can identify galaxies light-years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom, but we still haven't unlocked the mystery of the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears."*

*My Research Interest*

---

For a long time, I have been obessed with the mechanism **how cognition and intelligence come about in our brains**. So I pay my attention to research in neuroscience. 

From my perspective, relevant researches could be divided into 2 types: one focusing on the single neuron, the other showing more interest in the activities of neural network. Past decades have witnessed wonderful work in the level of single neuron. What's more, the great success ChatGPT or other AIs have achieved convince me that simple as a single neuron's behaviour is, by connecting with each other they can perform very complex tasks. **Therefore, I plan to dedicate myself into unveiling the puzzle of intelligence in the level of network.** 

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have seen many excellent modelling work analysing how neural network in specific region encodes and decodes information. It turns out that neuron assembly take various methods to handle information across different areas. **However, I am wondering whether there exist some basic rules in the level of network that each neuron should obey** and accordingly develop into such various encoders or decoders. 

Also, I am a big fan of deeper learning and eager to implement the efficient information processing in our brains into constructing more powerful artificial intelligence.

*Funny Story about My Interest in Neuroscience*

---

My interest in neuroscience begins in one day of my high school when I woke up from a nap, I would see a large number of repetitive visual short films in front of my eyes, such as the Donald Duck squatting and standing up again, etc. They slowly floated past my eyes, but if I fully opened my eyes, they disappeared completely. I wonder if the short clip I saw is the form  visual memory stored in the brain or in a dream. These short films are organized to form a coherent dream logically by my brain. Whether this hypothesis right or not, from that moment on, my interest in neuroscience was ignited.

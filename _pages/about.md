*"As humans we can identify galaxies light-years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom, but we still haven't unlocked the mystery of the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears."*

# üìñ About me
I am B.S. student major in life science at Department of Life Sciences and Medicine of University of Science and Technology of China(**USTC**). I will receive my Bachelor's Degree in 2025!

My research interest lies in exploration how our brains encode and decode information. I hope to solve this puzzle by modeling the neural network. Also, I am a big fan of machine learning and eager to implement the efficient information processing in our brains into constructing more powerful artificial intelligence.

My interest in neuroscience begins in one day of my high school when I woke up from a nap, I would see a large number of repetitive visual short films in front of my eyes, such as the
Donald Duck squatting and standing up again, etc. They slowly floated past my eyes, but if I fully opened my eyes, they disappeared completely. I wonder if the short clip I saw is the form  visual memory stored in the brain or in a dream. These short films are organized to form a coherent dream logically by my brain. Whether this hypothesis right or not, from that moment on, my interest in neuroscience was ignited.
